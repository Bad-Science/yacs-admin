# yacs-admin
Admin panel for the [YACS](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs) app.

## Current Functionality
Shows all courses, departments, schools, and sections in each model's respective index page.

## Future Functionality
Will implement full CRUD support.
Each model will have a show view as well as an index view, then when CUD is implemented in the YACS API, those will be implemented.
