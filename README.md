# yacs-admin
Admin panel for the [YACS](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs) app.

## Current Functionality
Shows all courses, departments, schools, and sections in each model's respective index page. Individual courses, departments, schools, and sections can also be viewed. Courses can be searched by department name/code, course name/description, and section instructors.

## Future Functionality
Will implement full CRUD support once it is in YACS API.
All add/update/delete operations will require authentication.
