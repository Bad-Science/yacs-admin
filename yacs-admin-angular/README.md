# YacsAdminAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. The dev server is run using fake data, so you can test the full functionality of the website without modifying any data in the YACS database.

## Staging server
Run `ng serve --env=staging` for a staging server with real data.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
Note: you may have to run `ng test` with the flag `--sm=false` if tests are failing. 
## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
